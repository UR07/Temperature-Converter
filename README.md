# Temperature-Converter 

## A temperature converter website is a simple and interactive tool that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. 


### This code creates a temperature converter website with inputs for Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperatures. The CSS styles the page with a centered layout and some basic styling for the form elements.

### The JavaScript handles the form submission and performs the temperature conversion based on the input values. 

### Users can enter a value in either Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin, and the corresponding temperature will be calculated and displayed automatically.
